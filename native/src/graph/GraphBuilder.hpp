/// MENU MODE — rows of controls, wired automatically: Left/Right within a row, Up/Down between
/// consecutive rows (two rows sharing a non-empty row key get column navigation — Up/Down
/// preserves the position instead of snapping to the first item). Items added outside an explicit
/// row become single-item rows (a plain vertical menu).
///
/// RAW MODE — AddNode + Connect for arbitrary topologies.
///
/// Orthogonal to both: BeginStop groups nodes into Tab-stops (arrows never cross a stop; Tab
/// cycles them), SetRegion tags nodes with a region for Ctrl+arrow jumps, and the PARENT STACK
/// builds the presentation hierarchy: PushContext pushes a non-focusable structural level
/// ("Difficulty settings, list" — announced when focus enters from outside), while BeginGroup
/// pushes a focusable, EXPANDABLE group header (a tree section) whose children only emit while
/// it's expanded — expansion state lives in the persistent set the builder is constructed with
/// (GraphState::Expanded), so screens hold no tree state of their own. Nesting recurses; a
/// collapsed ancestor suppresses everything beneath it.
///
