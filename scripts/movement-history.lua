Movement history tracking.

We have a number of modules which wish to do things based off whether or not a character moves: rulers (tones as the
character crosses one) and walking announcements among them.

We used to do this by carefully hooking the event system, but that is fragile for a variety of reasons, the biggest
among them being that if you do so too slowly, the char can move more than one tile.  So for example, with enough armor
equipment, you'd get gaps in belts.  Also, driving is the same as walking but faster from the perspective of these
modules. Just, not from the perspective of the Factorio API.

This module is a ringbuffer containing the last second of movement history per character: where that char was, and what
kind of movement (if any) it was doing.  History is represented by a tick number: 0 is "this tikck", 1 is a tick ago,
etc.

The position is the player's physical controller: the character, or in god mode (the sandbox) the god, which walks
without a body. Remote view moves only the camera, so it never shows up here.

For some idea how to use this, belt building walks the tiles between last tick and this tick, and bump detection checks
the prediction versus where we ended up.

Deals with the fact that we do not have the ability to know whether ticks happen before or after events.

We call this in on_tick and also when using the history reader, and it makes sure that the player's history is brought
up to this tick.
